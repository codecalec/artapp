			Jody is a gifted contemporary oil painter living in Durban, Kwa Zulu Natal. Her love of art
			began at school, obtaining an A in her Matric and being presented with the yearly Art Prize.
			On leaving school she trained as a professional nurse and worked in the pharmaceutical
			industry before raising a family. Her true passion for art never left her however and her
			desire to become a full time artist eventually came to fruition. Jody has since attended many
			art courses, both locally and overseas and has been a prolific artist with the successful
			Pascale Chandler stable in Durban, whose constructive criticism and encouragement has helped
			her greatly. Her work hangs in homes both in South Africa and internationally, and has had
			many successful exhibitions throughout the years. Jody is selective in her work, preferring
			figurative and portrait painting, capturing an intensity and vulnerability of emotions in her
			studies. Jody's words say it all - "If you are serious about painting, it calls for hard work,
			discipline, perseverance and often sacrifice and learning from mistakes. When I am satisfied
			with a completed work, I am very grateful and thankful for the gift that God has given me."
